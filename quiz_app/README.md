# quiz_app

A new Flutter project.

This is a Quiz App with a simple UI.
The App is mainly based on two fundamental Widgets - "Stateless" and "Statefull".

There are five basic questions. If we select an option and it is correct then the color of option changes to "green" and if it wrong then it changes to "red".
At the end there is a result page .That's it!

Thank you !!
